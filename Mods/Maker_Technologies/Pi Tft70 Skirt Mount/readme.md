I have created a simple Pi TFT70 Mount that attaches at the front top center skirt (like in the CAD). I was able to reuse the screws that came with my tft70. Think they are m2.5 (?). It creates a clean and sleek way to mount the tft while hiding the ribbon cable completetly. I have been using mine for months now and have had no issues. It is very important to keep this top bay cool so I do reccomend some active cooling.

As always, reach out if you have any questions...
