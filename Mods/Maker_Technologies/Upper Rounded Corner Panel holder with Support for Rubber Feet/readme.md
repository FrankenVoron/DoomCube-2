As the stock design does not support a way to hold the top panel down. I have created this part to solve this. I tried to keep it compatible with everything else. 
This model will also support putting rubber feet on the upper panels. This is for maitanence purposes only, keeps the printer off a ground a bit more too when flipped upside down. 
You will need to insert m3 heat set inserts into the holes of upper_corner. Then you can secure the caps with m3 hardware. The feet can be installed using an M5 screw.

I have included former versions of the models and their cad files for your convenience. I would reccomend only using V5 if V4 does not look good when printed. V5 has been altered to print better at the cost of some dimentional discrepencies. I am using V4 on my printer, a yet to be serialized Doom 300.
