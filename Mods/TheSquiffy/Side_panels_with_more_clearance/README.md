**Side panels with more clearance for DoomCube**

Original panel's distance it's set around 1.6mm, this sometimes gives few clearance for gantry's belts to move, scratching the panels and causing some noise during operation.

The purpose of this mod it's to reduce distance between the side panels from ~9.6mm down to 3.5mm, leaving up to 7mm clearance for belts.

This mod could also be applied to back panels even though it's not strictly necessary.

The design fills gaps between the extrusion bars and panels to avoid having small channels where dirt could end up.

I have personally installed to my DoomCube 250 and made 300 and 350 stl files but I couldn't test them directly.
