# "ANNEX ENGINEERING HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE EULA"

# TLDR: 

 - You want to use our files to make your own CAD / hardware / software that you distribute for free via Thingiverse/Github/elsewhere? 
   - Awesome; please credit us visibly and link to our github / website / discord. 
  Please do share the source ( CAD / source-code / similar ) but remove any of our parts - however, feel free to link to any referenced file!

 - You want to use our files to make edited versions of our designs and then sell them? 
	 - You are not allowed to do that.

 - You want to make stuff for our printers (beds, machined parts, 3D Printed Parts Kits, etc) and sell them? 
   - Cool; while we can't stop you from doing that without our assistance, we would greatly prefer that you work directly with us & contact us via Discord. We may even be able to add you to the sourcing guide and give you a vendor channel on Discord.

 - Want to fork or mod our stuff?
	 - Cool; All Forks, Modifications, Redistributions, etc must include a copy of this license.

 - You want to use our stuff to make your own original things (that are not based on Annex-files) and sell them? 
   - Great. Go for it, we love this.
